An iOS app built with Vue Native as a React Native Wrapper. Inkswell uses tinder-like swiping to match tattoo artists with clients. Clients swipe on artists' design styles, artists swipe on clients' ideas. If both users have swiped right on each other, there is a match and a channel of communication opens up. This was my capstone project from my time at Galvanize, but will continue to be a pet project on the side as I work to continue building out functionality and features.

This project runs off of expo, so be sure to have expo, x-code to view it in the browser. Install expo on your iphone to view it there. Styles are currently optimized for the iPhone 8

> Clone this repo

> $ npm install

> $ yarn install

> $ yarn start

> Scan QR with phone to see it in your phone with expo, or press 'i' to view it with the iOS simulator

> switch branch to "artist" to see the app in its current state as for logged in artist users.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
